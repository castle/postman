# Castle Postman Collections

Collections and Environments for use with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

Postman is a popular application for exploring API's through an intuitive interface. Many companies choose to use Postman for generating their API documentation. Many also offer collections for download so that API consumers can more easily explore API functionality.

Postman allows for environment variables to be defined and dynamically re-assigned via pre-request scripts and post-request scripts (i.e. test scripts). The collections defined in these folders utilize environment definitions, pre-request scripts, and test scripts.

## [Castle Environments](https://github.com/castle/postman/tree/master/castle-environments)
